"body": "Data transmission, encoding, link control techniques, network architecture, design, protocols, and multiple access. CMPEN 461 Communication Networks (3) This course introduces students to fundamental concepts and principles underlying data communication networks, with an emphasis on the Internet and its five-layer architecture: the application, transport, network, link, and physical layers. The fundamental issues to be covered include, but not limited to, reliable communication over an unreliable network layer, connection establishment/teardown and handshaking, congestion and flow control, path determination, multiple access control. The student learning these principles will gain knowledge that lasts long after today&rsquo;s network standards and protocols have become obsolete.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN271 ; CMPSC121 or CMPSC201)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
