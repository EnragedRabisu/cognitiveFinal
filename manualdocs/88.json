"body": "This course provides an overview of the theory, research paradigms, implementation techniques, and philosophy of artificial intelligence. A wide range of topics are covered that include search, problem solving, and game-playing, as well as knowledge, reasoning and belief networks. The material includes a brief introduction to machine learning and classification problems. Through programming assignments that sample these topics, students acquire an understanding of what it means to build rational agents of different sorts, especially the contrast between agents that operate in certain versus uncertain environments. Applications to specific areas of AI such as language and vision are presented.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC 221 CONCURRENT: CMPSC 465)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
