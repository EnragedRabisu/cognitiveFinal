"body": "Introduction to logic design and digital systems. Boolean algebra, and introduction to combinatorial and sequential circuit design and analysis. Students may take only one course for credit for CMPEN 270 or 271. CMPEN 271CMPEN 271 Introduction to Digital Systems (3)This course introduces students to logic design and digital systems. The course begins with an overview of number systems, base conversions, and binary arithmetic. Boolean algebra is presented and several basic theorems and postulates are introduced. Boolean algebra is then used to model digital devices. Canonical forms for expressing Boolean functions are introduced including sum-of-products and product-of-sum forms.Basic Small Scale Integrated (SSI) combinational devices are introduced along with a description of their operations characterization, and use. The basic symbols used in a logic diagram/schematic are introduced and the principles involved in reading and creating logic diagrams/schematics are discussed.A systematic design methodology for combinational circuits is covered, including the concepts of function minimization using Karnaugh maps, handling don't care conditions, and designing multiple output circuits. Medium Scale Integrated (MSI) combinational devices and functions such as multiplexors and decoders are discussed and their use in a variety of applications is explained. Simple programmable logic devices and their use in implementing combinational functions is covered. The process of combinational circuit analysis is discussed and the use and interpretation of timing diagrams is introduced. Binary arithmetic is reviewed along with binary addition and subtraction circuits. Various negative number codes are discussed including 2's complement, l's complement and sign-magnitude representation.The concept of state and memory is introduced along with various sequential devices including the R-S latch, the D latch and the D, T, and J-K flip-flops. Timing considerations such as set-up and hold times for sequential devices is discussed along with various flip-flop triggering methods. The basic model for a sequential circuit/finite state machine is introduced. A systematic design methodology for creating synchronous sequential circuits is covered including state table/diagram creation, state reduction, state assignment, and circuit implementation. The process of sequential circuit analysis is also described.Special sequential devices and circuits are introduced including counters and registers. Their use in various applications is highlighted. The course ends with a discussion of memory devices including RAM's and ROM'S.Throughout the course, students use a schematic capture and design simulation CAD tool to model and test a variety of circuits.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Concurrent: PHYS 212)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
