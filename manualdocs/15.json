"body": "Theory, design, and implementation of digital circuits based on combinational and sequential circuits; implementation of designs using hardware description language. CMPEN 371 Advanced Digital Design (3) Students will learn advanced concepts in digital design for complex combinational and sequential logic, and learn how to effectively use minimization and synthesis techniques. Contemporary CAD tools and target digital technologies including Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are utilized. The use of a hardware-description language for digital design is introduced. In the laboratory portion, students will implement, simulate, and test designs.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN271 ; CMPEN275 ; CMPSC121 or CMPSC201 ; E E 210 or E E 211)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
