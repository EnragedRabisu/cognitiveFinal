"body": "Compiler design and implementation; scanning, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization (including static analysis), code generation, garbage collection, and error detection. CMPSC 470 Compiler Construction (3) The primary topics of this course are areas of compiler construction that are applicable both in building compilers and in many other areas of computer science. Both the concepts and the implementation of these techniques will be emphasized. Study of these topics should improve student skills in programming, debugging and software engineering.This course is an elective for students in both the BS COMP and MS COMP programs. The course builds on concepts learned in earlier programming, data structure and computer organization courses.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC221 , CMPSC312 , CMPSC462 , CMPSC469)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
