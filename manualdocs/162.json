"body": "Design, computer simulation, and practical implementation of systems in the areas of filtering, digital signal processing, and controls. E E 383 Signals and Controls Laboratory (1) In this course, students will be exposed to designing, simulating and implementing practical circuits for filtering of signals, digital signal processing, and control of physical processes. The design aspect of the course will be a direct extension of the two associated lecture courses (E E 352 and E E 380). The simulations will use industry standard software tools (e.g., MATLAB, Hyperception, C/C++) while the actual implementation will be accomplished using PC based DSP hardware in addition to analog circuitry. This will be a hands-on laboratory intended to augment the material presented in E E 352 and E E 380. Students will be expected to do a large portion of pre-lab work before starting the laboratory session.(Credits: 1)(Prerequisites: Concurrent: E E 352; E E 380)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
