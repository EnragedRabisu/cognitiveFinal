"body": "Recommended Preparations: DS 310; CMPSC 448 This course introduces modern programming models and related software stacks for performing scalable data analytics and discovery tasks over massive and/or high dimensional datasets. The learning objectives of the course are that the students are able to choose appropriate programming models for a big data application, understand the tradeoff of such choice, and be able to leverage state-of-the art cyber infrastructures to develop scalable data analytics or discovery tasks. Building on data models covered in DS 220, this course will introduce programming models such as MapReduce, data flow supports for modern cluster computing environment, and programming models for large-scale clustering (either a large number of data samples or a large number of dimensions). Using these frameworks and languages, the students will learn to implement data aggregation algorithms, iterative algorithms, and algorithms for generating statistical information from massive and/or high-dimensional data. The realization of these algorithms will enable the students to develop data analytic models for massive datasets.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Enforced Prerequisite: CMPSC 122 and DS 220. Recommended Preparation: DS 310 or CMPSC 448.)(Additional Attributes: Cross-listed with: DS 410)",
