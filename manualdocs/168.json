"body": "Engineering design and modelling, engineering economy, project planning, capstone project selection, and technical communication skills. E E 400 Engineering Design Concepts (3) This course prepares senior electrical engineering students for industrial engineering design and project management. It covers the engineering design process, project planning and evaluation, engineering ethics, and engineering economy. . In addition, students select, specify, and start their capstone design project which is completed in the follow-up course, EE BD 481. Students are expected to carry out a group design project that is on par with industrial expectations. Upon completion of this course a student should have a solid understanding of the engineering design process, a clear capstone project description, should have completed some preliminary design work, and be adequately prepared to complete the project in E E 401.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 313W ; E E 316 ; E E 352 ; E E 380 ; seventh-semester standing)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
