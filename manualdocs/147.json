"body": "E E 317 Circuits II and Data Acquisition This course is a follow up to the introductory circuit analysis course. The first part of this course is devoted to the study of multi-phase circuits, magnetic coupling, two-port networks and their applications. The second part of the course is devoted to automated instrument control with emphasis on data acquisition and processing, and printed circuit boards manufacturing. Student performance is evaluated using exams, homework assignments, and projects. Concepts introduced in lecture are reinforced with hands-on experience provided by laboratory projects.(Credits: 2)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 210; CMPSC 201 or CMPSC 121 or CMPSC 101)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
