"body": "Network architectures, communication protocols, internetworking, network security, client-server computing, web application development, programming with APIs. CMPSC 448 Machine Learning and Algorithmic AI (3) Machine learning and artificial intelligence are closely-related branches of computer science that deal with the development of software that can "learn" how to perform useful tasks from prior data. Machine learning is mostly concerned with inferring trends from data in order to use them for future predictions. Artificial intelligence is mostly concerned about how to use knowledge gained from previous data to achieve specific goals.This course provides an introduction to important concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as probabilistic and mathematical tools needed for applications of technology from both fields. Students will learn about important models and algorithmic frameworks used in machine learning such as linear models, neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, adaboost, k-means clustering, and agglomerative clustering as well as methods for evaluating and tuning these models. Students will also learn about key artificial intelligence concepts such as A* search and reinforcement learning which are used by software agents (such as game AI's) to navigate and explore their environment.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC221 , CMPSC312)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
