"body": "Performing the initial research needed for the capstone course, and the preparation of the written project proposal. E E 405 Capstone Proposal Preparation (1) The capstone design course will incorporate engineering standards and realistic constraints including most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; manufacturability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political. While engineering constraints are included in the earlier courses, the senior capstone design requires integration of the appropriate engineering constraints into the capstone design course. This course will mimic the problems encountered by an engineer working in commercial, industrial, and governmental entities. This basically requires that students in the Electrical Engineering BS program select a topic prior to starting the semester of their capstone design course, do the initial research for the topic, prepare a timeline, and prepare a well written proposal that would make a suitable capstone project. The time devoted to the careful topic selection, research, timeline, and proposal preparation, makes for a much better capstone design experience.(Credits: 1)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: senior level standing; ENGL 202C ; CAS 100)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
