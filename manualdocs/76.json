"body": "UNIX OS including file system, utilities, and shell scripting; C programming, including I/O, pointers, arrays, dynamic memory, macros, and libraries. CMPSC 402CMPSC 402 Unix and C (3)The primary goal of the course is to provide students with sufficient information to enable them to write structured and readable C programs for realistic applications. In particular, after completing the course students should be familiar with and be able to use pointers and dynamic memory management techniques.A secondary goal is for the students to be fluent in using the Unix operating system, particularly those parts needed for program development.Students will be evaluated on midterm and final exams, and four to five problem sets. The exams will be worth 50% of the total grade and the problem sets will be worth the remaining 50%.This course is an elective in the computer science (COMP) BS program. Students in other programs generally use it as an elective. Students cannot take this course after having taken CMPSC 422.No special Facilities, are needed for this course. The course will usually be offered once a year with an expected enrollment of 30-40.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC121)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
