E E 352 Signals and Systems (4) E E 352 is a course designed to study the characteristics of continuous and discrete time linear systems. These include signal and power input/output relationships in both domains, impulse responses, and the differential equations that describe these systems. Convolution is an essential component of any linear systems course, therefore several classes will be devoted to this topic in order that students fully understand the concept. Fourier series is used to determine the spectral content of periodic signals thus illustrating how a signal is distributed in frequency. This is very important when determining bandwidth requirements. There will be a brief refresher on the trigonometric Fourier series then the exponential series will be studied extensively. The Fourier transform can be used to determine the spectral content of virtually any signal encountered in the undergraduate curriculum, aperiodic, or periodic. It is also valuable in determining the frequency response characteristics of linear systems. Some filter theory is included in the course along with the Laplace transform. Much of the signal processing performed today is done digitally so the remainder of the course will approach most of the aforementioned topics from the viewpoint of the discrete domain with a strong emphasis on sampling and aliasing. Finite impulse response filters will be introduced along with recursive filters using the bilinear transform method.(Credits: 4)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: MATH 250 ; E E 210 or E E 314 or E E 315)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
