"body": "Introduction to computer architecture. Memory hierarchy and design, CPU design, pipelining, multiprocessor architecture. CMPEN 431 Introduction to Computer Architecture (3) This course will introduce students to the architecture-level design issues of a computer system. They will apply their knowledge of digital logic design to explore the high-level interaction of the individual computer system hardware components. Concepts of sequential and parallel architecture including the interaction of different memory components, their layout and placement, communication among multiple processors, effects of pipelining, and performance issues, will be covered. Students will apply these concepts by studying and evaluating the merits and demerits of selected computer system architectures.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN331 or CMPEN371)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
