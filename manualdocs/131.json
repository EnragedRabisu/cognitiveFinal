"body": "A working knowledge of electrical engineering design tools and hardware realization of electrical engineering systems. E E 200 Design Tools (3) E E 200 provides students with a working set of design tools that are required to complete subsequent courses in the electrical engineering design curriculum. This course directly builds upon circuit analysis/design concepts in the required introductory courses in electrical circuits, digital systems and computer programming. Specific topics covered in this course include automated instrument control, hardware realization using field programmable devices, hardware realization using embedded microcontroller systems, circuit simulation and printed circuit board layout. Student performance is evaluated using exams, homework assignments, and projects. Concepts introduced in lecture are reinforced with hands-on experience provided by laboratory projects.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 210 , CMPEN270 or CMPEN271 and CMPEN275 , CMPSC201 or CMPSC121 ; Prerequisite or concurrent E E 310)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
