"body": "Introduction to methods of software verification, validation, and testing; mathematical foundations of testing, reliability models; statistical testing. SWENG 431 Software Verification, Validation, and Testing (3) Provides a background necessary for verification, validation, and testing of software systems. Verification addresses the question: &quot;are we building the product right?&quot; In other words, does the product meet the engineering specifications? Validation addresses whether the right product is being built and if it meets the design requirements. The testing aspect of the course addresses many of the methods available to test software systems. The levels of testing explored are 1) unit level (each module is tested independently), 2) integration testing (where the modules are integrated together and tested as a complete system), and 3) acceptance testing (the testing requirements of the users). Following this, specific test methodologies are addressed. By the end of this course the student should also be able to develop an appropriate test plan.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: SWENG411 ; STAT 301)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
