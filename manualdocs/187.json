"body": "The physics of semiconductors as related to the characteristics and design of solid state electronic devices. E E 442 Solid State Devices (3) The objective of E E 442, an electrical engineering elective course taken by seniors and graduate students, is to develop a rigorous introduction to the relevant concepts in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics pertaining to understanding the key physical mechanisms that govern the electrical, optical and even mechanical behavior of semiconductor materials and devices. This course explicitly deals with the physics of operation of electronic and optoelectronic devices, and expounds on the practical aspects of device design given the inherently non-ideal nature of semiconductor devices in real life. The course typically features a couple of invited guest lectures from leading experts involved in the state-of-the-art research on semiconductor materials and devices so that seniors and first year graduate students learn about the recent advances in electronic and optoelectronic devices which reside outside the scope of the recent text books. Nanoelectronics today is a very broad discipline that extends the traditional solid-state devices such as transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, photodetectors, laser diodes commonly found in electronic and optoelectronic integrated circuits to a variety of emerging technologies such as large area flexible electronics, energy conversion devices, chemical and biological sensors, microelectromechanical devices. A continuous trend of fundamental breakthroughs at the materials and device architecture level keeps this field exciting and opens up new application space hitherto unexplored. The opportunity exists for the students taking this course to get introduced at a broad level to each of these areas. This course will serve as a cornerstone of the students&rsquo; electronics education should they join the 275 billion dollar global semiconductor industry or should they decide to pursue graduate education in the area of advanced materials and devices.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 310 ; E E 340 or E E 341 or E SC 314)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
