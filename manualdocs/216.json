"body": "Design, documentation, testing, and construction of software using software engineering strategies embodied in object-oriented programming languages. SWENG 311 Object-Oriented Software Design and Construction (3) Object-oriented design and programming embody powerful design strategies that are based on practical and proven software engineering techniques. In this class, students will learn how existing object-oriented languages support these strategies, how to apply these strategies to moderately-sized systems, and how to use a visual object-oriented modeling tool such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Students will build on programming skills acquired in prerequisite programming courses by programming in a major object-oriented programming language.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC122)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
