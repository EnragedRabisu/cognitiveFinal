"body": "Data transmission, basic signaling, data encoding, error control, communication protocols, security, network topologies, routing, switching, internetworking, emerging high speed networks. CMPSC 436CMPSC 436 Communications and Networking (3)This course introduces the elements and architecture of computer and data communication networks, demonstrates the fundamental principles of computer networking, and provides experience in the practical use of current networking technology. Topics in this course include: data communications (basic signaling, data transmission, data encoding, errors and error control), communications architecture and protocols (communication protocols, internetworking, transport protocols, layered network architecture, network security) and computer networks (WANs, LANs, network topologies, internetworking, routing and switching strategies and emerging high speed networks).After taking CMPSC 436, students should be able to:1) understand the fundamentals of networking concepts and terminology2) define and contrast the classifications local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), and wide area network (WAN)3) name and describe basic networking elements4) define the roles of clients, servers, and peers as they relate to computer networks5) define the term "protocol" and explain how it relates to computer networks6) identify specific network management areas and describe the organizational issues relating to each of themStudents will be evaluated on homework (35% of grade), semester exams (35%), and a final comprehensive exam (30%).This course is an elective in the computer science (COMP) BS curriculum. This course is intended to be taken by second semester juniors or seniors.No special facilities are required for this course. This course will be offered once per year, with an expected enrollment of 60.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC312)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
