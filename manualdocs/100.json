"body": "Visualization techniques for data analysis and presentation. Applying visualization and perceptual theory. Using extending platform independent visualization software. CMPSC 459CMPSC 459 Scientific Visualization (3)Visualization of scientific data and processes has always been important for gaining insights into scientific phenomena. Historically, such visualization has taken place in the scientist's imagination and was then rendered in drawings, graphs and diagrams. The rapid advance of computer technology, and in particular, computer graphics, has made new tools available to the scientist to aid in the interpretation and communication of scientific information. In this course students will study a variety of computer graphics, scientific visualization, and virtual reality techniques and apply them to scientific visualization projects. The projects will be drawn from all of the sciences and the resulting projects will then be available to faculty and students to use as tools in their disciplines.The prerequisites for this course are CMPSC 122. Students will apply the writing skills gained in ENGL 202C and refine them in the context of scientific writing. They will also have the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills gained in CMPBD 360 and its predecessors, CSE 103 and CSE 120 within the context of a significant natural science or mathematical visualization problem. Software and languages used in this course will change as the discipline of scientific visualization evolves. Currently, programming will be done in C++ and Java; VRML and other virtual reality languages, and scientific specialty languages such as IDL, muPad, xpp, Mathematica, Maple, etc. Projects initiated in this course can form the basis for further development as a 494 research project.The course will take advantage of a variety of computing platforms available at Behrend including Windows NT and Unix.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC122)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
