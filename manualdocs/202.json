"body": "Sampling and hold operations; A/D and D/A conversions; modeling of digital systems; response evaluation; stability; basis of digital control; examples. E E 482 Introduction to Digital Control Systems (3) E E 482 introduces fundamental concepts that will enable the student to analyze, design, and synthesize closed-loop systems that contain a digital computer. In order to successfully complete this course the student must have a foundation in classical control (E E 380 or equivalent) and discrete-time system concepts (E E 351 or equivalent). Problem solving is emphasized. Concepts introduced in lecture are reinforced by a series of laboratory projects and weekly problem sets. Through these exercises the student will acquire competence in analytical and computer aided analysis techniques.The course covers several topic areas including modeling of sampled-data systems, system identification using the batch least squares method, time response characteristics, stability analysis techniques, discrete-time approximation of continuous-time controllers, classical design methods based on root locus and frequency response, and modern design methods including state and observer feedback design.Laboratory projects include system identification and control design based on the root locus, frequency response, and state-feedback methods. Each project involves the use of either a servomechanism or a fluid testbed. Laboratory projects and problem sets will develop the student's appreciation for computer aided control system analysis and design techniques. Student performance is assessed using homework, laboratory projects, hour exams, and a final exam.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 380 ; E E 351 or E E 352)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
