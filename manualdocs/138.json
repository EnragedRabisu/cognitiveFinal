"body": "Introduction to the electrical engineering design process, project teaming and management, and technical communication. E E 300W Design Process (3) E E 300W course will introduce students to the electrical engineering design process, project teaming, and project management in preparation for conducting a senior design project. In the lab, students will get practice managing a project from pre-definition to completion within constraints of customer needs, technical parameters and budgets. The principles of systems engineering will be introduced. The student-engineer will gain professional skills (in areas such as technical communication, teaming, conflict resolution and life-long learning) important for a successful career in a wide range of engineering environments. There will also be discussion of engineering ethics and the responsibilities of the engineer in the emerging global marketplace. A series of lectures by outside speakers will provide perspectives on life as an engineer.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 200 Concurrent: ENGL 202C)(Additional Attributes: Writing Across the Curriculum)",
