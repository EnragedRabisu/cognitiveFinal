"body": "In-depth theoretical study of data structures such as balanced trees, hash tables, priority queues, B-trees, binomial heaps, and Fibonacci heaps. CMPSC 462 Data Structures (3) The primary goals of this course are (1) to provide the students with a set of basic data structures useful in the design of efficient algorithms, and (2) to provide the students with the ability to design and analyze new data structures as needed to solve problems. The secondary goal of this course is to introduce basic algorithm analysis techniques to prepare the students for the follow up course CMPSC 463, Design and Analysis of Algorithms. This is a required course in the BS COMP program. It is also a prerequisite for a number of other courses in the COMP program such CMPSC 463, 460, 430, etc.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC360)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
