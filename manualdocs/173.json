E E 410 Linear Electronic Design (3) E E 410 is a technical elective intended for electrical engineering students who wish to specialize in semiconductor circuits, especially in linear circuit design. The course emphasizes integrated circuit process-compatible circuit design techniques in recognition of the amazing synergy that has characterized the relationship between modern circuits and integrated circuit processing technology. This course is the third in a series of three courses dealing with the analysis and design of electronics circuits, following E E 310 and E E 311. E E 410 includes three lectures and a two-hour laboratory each week.E E 410 begins with a deeper look into several key concepts previously considered in earlier course work, such as node voltage and mesh current methods for solving circuits, which are emphasized throughout the course. The small-signal method is revisited and thoroughly examined. The more advanced Ebers-Moll bipolar junction transistor model is introduced and the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor device model is reviewed.The next phase of the course introduces the vertical geometries of integrated circuit devices commonly used in linear circuits. Unwanted parasitic devices that are introduced as a result of the integrated circuit processes are revealed and their effects on circuit sign techniques operation are discussed. Both the limitations and the opportunities provided by integrated circuit technology are examined, particularly in the light of de used to minimize the problems and to take advantage of the features.The last half of the course is devoted to applications of linear circuits, especially those which students have not previously encountered. The first topics in this series are analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. Various methods of accomplishing each of these functions are examined. The inverse relationship between speed and accuracy is emphasized. These topics are followed by studies of switched capacitor filters, phase lock loops, analog multipliers, and voltage-controlled oscillators.The emphasis of the laboratory component of the course is to successfully accomplish a student-chosen linear circuit design project. Students work in two- or three-person teams to select their project and do the design and evaluation. A three-way methodology is emphasized; mathematical analysis by hand, computer simulation, and laboratory breadboarding and measurement. At the end of the project students give an oral presentation and submit a formal engineering report.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 311)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
