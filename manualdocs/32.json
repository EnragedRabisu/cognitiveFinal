"body": "Microprocessors: architecture, design, assembly language, programming, interfacing, bus structure, and interface circuits and their use in embedded systems. CMPEN 472 Microprocessors and Embedded Systems (3) In this course students should learn about the operation and design of microprocessor-based systems, including both hardware and software aspects with an emphasis on real time control environments and embedded systems. After completing the course, students should be able to develop, write and debug programs in a microprocessor's assembly language and use standard assembly language program development tools. They should also be able to interpret and analyze basic microprocessor system hardware.This course is a senior level elective for students in computer engineering and computer science.The course requires the use of general department computing facilities consisting of UNIX workstations running the appropriate program development tools.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN331)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
