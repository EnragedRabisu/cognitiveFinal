"body": "The course covers advanced object-oriented principles and their application to web-based, net-centric computing. Major topics include virtual machines, intermediate code generation (Java-specific), graphical user interfaces (GUI) design, event handling, server-side programming with database queries, and security, permissions and file management concepts for client/server systems. Extensive programming assignments provide an understanding of the entire process of client/server development including interface prototyping, program design, implementation of both client and server programs, unit testing, and documentation. This course prepares students to meet immediate demands in solving complex computational problems.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC 122 OR CMPSC 132)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
