"body": "Engineering design and modeling, engineering economy, project planning, capstone project selections, and technical communication skills. CMPEN 480 Computer Engineering Design (3) This course prepares senior computer engineering students for industrial engineering design and project management. It covers the engineering design process, project planning and evaluation, engineering ethics, and engineering economy. In addition, students select, specify, and start their capstone design project, which is completed, in the follow-up course, CMPEN 481. Students are expected to carry out a group design project that is on par with industrial expectations. Upon completion of this course a student should have a solid understanding of the engineering design process, a clear capstone project description, should have completed some preliminary design work, and be adequately prepared to complete the project in CMPEN 481.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN352W ; CMPEN431)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
