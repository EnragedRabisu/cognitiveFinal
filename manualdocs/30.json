"body": "This course explores the fundamental concepts and engineering processes of wireless communication systems, sensors, and security algorithms through the design, implementation, and evaluation of next generation wireless network architectures, and network and cryptographic protocols. This course is intended as a senior level course for computational majors such as computer science and computer engineering since it covers hardware and software design concepts associated with wireless access, data transmission, and computational security, security models, and privacy in a broad range of settings. The first part of the course studies programmatic, computational, and engineering issues associated with wireless systems and sensors at the physical protocol layer. Hardware, software, and engineering design considerations associated with MIMO, low latency, high reliability, and high data rate constraints will be analyzed. The next part of this course will introduce virtual machines, function virtualization, and network-slicing for constraint matching, resource scheduling, and mobility management at the data link and network protocol layers. The final component of the course focuses on the security and privacy for wireless systems and sensors including models and algorithms. The design and implementation of cryptographic algorithms for cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and next generation systems including Device to Device (D2D), Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V),and Machine Type Communications (MTC) are studied and analyzed. Upon completion of the course students will be able to critically analyze the design, implementation, and protocols associated with wireless systems and sensors and assess the computational security and privacy vulnerabilities associated with these systems.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisites: CMPEN 362 OR EE 362)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
