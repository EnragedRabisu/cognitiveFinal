"body": "Project designs of analog and digital systems, interfacing, and relevant electronic circuits, with an emphasis on technical communications skills. EE 406 Electrical Engineering Capstone Design(3) is designed with the following goals and objectives: * The students will enter the course with a well-defined capstone design proposal and a timeline for which the first task will be to write the specifications. Upon the specifications' approval, the student teams will begin designing and building the projects. * Each student will maintain a laboratory notebook that documents the day-to-day activities of the project in a style that could be used for patent documentation. * Team members will provide short oral and written reports every week for the first five to six weeks, and then, every two weeks until the end of the semester. * The students will incorporate engineering standards and constraints, i.e., consideration of economic, environmental, sustainability, manufacturability, ethical, safety, etc., in their project and final report. * A draft copy of the final report will be collected, critiqued, and returned to students with comments and suggestions for changes. * A final project oral report (20 - 25 minutes) will be given by the project team during the last week of the semester. * An extensive well-written report describing the project that has been designed and built, is the major outcome of the capstone design course. This course is a required course in the Electrical Engineering BS curriculum and is intended to be taken by seniors as the capstone course for the major. As such, the course integrates materials from many of the undergraduate electrical courses in addition to related math, engineering, and science courses.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 405)(Additional Attributes: Writing Across the Curriculum)",
