"body": "Artificial Neural Networks as a solving tool for difficult problems for which conventional methods are not applicable. E E (E SC/EGEE) 456 Introduction to Neural Networks (3) This course is in response to students needs to learn Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a solving tool for difficult problems for which conventional methods are not available. The objective of this course is to give students hands-on experiences in identifying the best types of ANN, plus developing and applying ANN to solve difficult problems. Students will be introduced to a variety of ANN and will use their training skills to solve their own applications. During this course the students will develop a final project, in which they will apply ANN to widely varied problems.Examples: I) students from E E may be interested in applying ANN to solve control problems; II ) students from Material Sciences may be interested in applying ANN to predict the pitting corrosion of components; III) students from Petroleum Engineering may be interested in applying ANN to characterize the life of a reservoir; IV ) students from Agricultural Engineering may be interested in applying ANN to sort apples automatically, etc.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC201 or CMPSC202 ; MATH 220)(Additional Attributes: Cross-Listed)",
