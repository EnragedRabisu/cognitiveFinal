"body": "The main goal of this course is to explore the relational database model, with special emphasis on the design and querying of relational databases. Secondary goals include exploration of the mathematical basis for relational databases and exploration of the relationship of database to the rest of computer science. Study of these topics should improve student skills in programming, modeling the structure of data and using and administering databases. After completing CMPSC 430 the student should be able to: (1) Demonstrate comprehension of general database concepts (2) Identify key issues in developing database systems and applications (3) Explain the general organization of a relational database and explain the functions of the basic relational operators (4) Use query languages, in particular, Structured Query Language (SQL), to define, maintain, and query relational databases (5) Model a relational database through entity-relationship (ER) modeling and construct ER diagrams (6) Explain the methodologies used to conceptualize and design database systems (7) Apply decomposition and analyze/construct functional dependencies (8) Demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of relation normalization and the supporting fundamental knowledge of efficient database implementation(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Concurrent Courses: CMPSC 462)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
