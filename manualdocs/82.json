CMPSC 426 Object-Oriented Design (3) The primary goal of this course is to study the object-oriented design paradigm, including modeling languages, classes and objects, the inheritance relationship, polymorphism, and software engineering topics relating to object-oriented design. Study of this topic should provide a solid understanding of object-orientation for students to use in studying diverse topics such as operating systems, software engineering, and database design. This course is an elective for students in the BS COMP program. The course builds on topics learned in earlier object-oriented programming courses.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC221 , CMPSC462)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
