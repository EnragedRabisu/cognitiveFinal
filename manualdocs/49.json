"body": "An introduction to logic and its application to problem solving and computer science. CMPSC 111S Logic for Computer Science (1)Computer Science provides the fundamental tools for analyzing problems and designing solutions to these problems which can be implemented on a computer. Logic plays an important role in this process, from a general-purpose tool for reasoning about knowledge to a special-purpose language for specifying the behavior of programs and designing hardware. This course examines the role of logic in problem solving and its application to computer science and computer engineering. Example problems will be drawn from a variety of sources, including brain teasers, puzzles, and mathematics. We will show how these problems and their solutions apply to real problems involving computers. We will also explore a number of the important areas of computer science and computer engineering including Boolean and Digital Logic, Designing Arithmetic Hardware, Cryptography and Security Programming Languages, Networking and Wireless Communication, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Ethics.(Credits: 1)(Prerequisites: NONE)(Additional Attributes: First-Year Seminar)",
