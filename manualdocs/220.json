"body": "Software engineering principles including life cycle, dependability, process modeling, project management, requires specification, design analysis, implementation, testing, and maintenance. SWENG 411 Software Engineering (3) This is an introductory course in software engineering, addressing the software development process, including aspects such as software requirements documentation, design specification, implementation, system integration, testing, and maintenance by individuals and teams. Topics include software process modeling, requirements elicitation and documentation, software architecture design and analysis, detailed design and programming, graphical user interface (GUI's) design and prototyping, software quality assessment, software testing, software maintenance and evolution management, personal and team-based development. In lab students gain practical experience by completing programming assignments and utilizing computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools for their personal projects tailored to each stage of the software life cycle. A semester long team-based project is required that reinforces teamwork fundamentals and the concepts covered in lecture. The projects and assignments provide an opportunity for student teamwork, document writing, and oral presentations.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC122; Concurrent: SWENG311)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
