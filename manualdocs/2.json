"body": "Introduction to digital systems and their design. Topics include combinational and sequential devices and circuits, modern design tools and design practices. Students may take only one course for credit for CMPEN 270 or CMPEN 271 and CMPEN 270 or CMPEN 275. CMPEN 270 Digital Design: Theory and Practice (4)CMPEN 270 is a first course in digital systems and digital system's design. It lays the groundwork for many later courses in computer organization and architecture and switching theory. The course includes both a lecture component to introduce important concepts, principles, methodologies and theories and a laboratory component in which the lecture material can be applied and practiced. The course introduces the theoretical foundation for digital systems including number systems, a variety of commonly used codes and Boolean algebra. Combinational devices, logic gates, and sequential devices, latches and flip-flops are introduced along with design techniques, methods and tools. Design criteria and objectives are considered and design trade-offs are examined. Higher level design elements are also examined such as decoders, multiplexers, counters, and registers, and their use in system design. Students are exposed to a variety of design tools and implementation techniques, including schematic capture tools, simulation tools, Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and HDL design tools. Laboratory work includes the design, construction and debugging of a variety of digital circuits, and the use of standard laboratory tools such as the oscilloscope and logic analyzer, and various software design tools.(Credits: 4)(Prerequisites: NONE)(Additional Attributes: CONCURRENT COURSE PHYS 212)",
