"body": "Electronic circuit design with consideration to single and multi-device subcircuits, frequency response characteristics, feedback, stability, efficiency, and IC techniques. E E 311 Electronic Circuit Design II (3) E E 311 is intended to provide competency in the application of basic electronic principles to design with operational amplifiers and integrated circuits. The course will include passive and active filter design, and feedback principles and non-ideal aspects of operational amplifiers (op-amps) including compensation, stability, and sensitivity needed for advanced design with op-amps, as well as some nonlinear op-amp circuits including comparators, Schmitt triggers, pulse width modulators, and waveform generators.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 310 ; E E 350 or E E 352)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
