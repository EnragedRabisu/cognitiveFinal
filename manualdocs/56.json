"body": "Development and implementation of algorithms in a procedure-oriented language, with emphasis on numerical methods for engineering problems. A student may receive credit for only one of the following courses: CMPSC 101, 102, 200, 201, or 202. CMPSC 200 CMPSC 200 Programming for Engineers with MATLAB (3) CMPSC 200 is a service course offered to engineering and science majors. The course teaches basic programming concepts including: algorithm development, data types, number representation, control structures, functions, plotting and basic numerical analysis techniques. The course enables students to develop computer programs in MATLAB to solve simple engineering problems. The basic numerical analysis techniques covered in the course include matrix operations, systems of equations, solving equations, roots, curve fitting, interpolation, numerical integration and ordinary differential equations.Students analyze physics-based and engineering problems; develop algorithms to solve the problems; implement the algorithms in the MATLAB programming environment; and produce informative output in both numerical and graphical form. The general programming concepts learned in the course are commonly found in most programming language environments. The problem-solving skills learned in the course can be utilized in upper-level engineering and science courses.The lecture portion of the course gives students the conceptual and syntactical background needed for the successful completion of practical programming assignments during the laboratory portion of the course. The laboratory instruction involves hands-on programming by individual students or student teams assisted by a teaching assistant and/or instructor.Evaluation methods may include examinations, in-class labs, and programming projects. The course is generally held in a STEC room where each student has access to a computer. The course will be offered during the Spring semester.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: MATH 140; Concurrent: MATH 141)(Additional Attributes: General Education: Quantification (GQ))",
