"body": "Overview of energy alternatives available, and study of theory of operation and models of major energy conversion devices. E E 485 Energy Systems and Conversion (3) The course is designed to give students an overview of available energy alternatives, and to study the fundamental theory of operation and system models for major energy conversion devices. The topics covered give students the tools to assess the viability of various energy options, their applications, and their impact on the environment. Various forms of raw energy sources used in powering conventional electric generating plants such as coal, natural gas, oil, and uranium will be studied, along with worldwide distribution and reserves. The analytical tools for determining quantities of energy that could be extracted from the wind, water falls, and solar energy sources using practical devices will be presented in the course as well as various case studies. The state of the art in energy storage technology and its impact on electrical vehicle range will be presented in the first half of the semester. The second half of the semester 's devoted to studying the theoretical fundaments and applications of major energy conversion devices. Magnetic circuits covers the electrical circuit model and analog for studying energy transfer involving magnetic systems. The link to a direct application - power transformers is established, and then to rotating magnetic machines in general. The poly-phase AC induction motor circuit model, energy flow, and selection for various load types will be covered. Modem speed control techniques using inverters will also be covered. The principles of operation of the synchronous energy converter will be explored and its unique features. The power angle characteristics and its relationship to stability of a power system will be covered. Presentation on theory and applications of classical DC motors and generators, and the newer permanent magnet (PM) machines with their superior performance characteristics and energy density will conclude the semester.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 314 or E E 315 ; MATH 250)(Additional Attributes: Cross-Listed)",
