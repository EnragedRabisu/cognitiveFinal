"body": "Generic communication system; signal transmission; digital communication systems; amplitude modulation; angle modulation. E E 360 Communications Systems (3) E E 360 is a junior-level elective course in the electrical engineering curriculum that provides a detailed foundation of communications systems, expanding on the topics covered in a standard linear systems class. The first part of the course deals with analog communications. First, analog amplitude modulation (AM) is presented, covering double-sideband suppressed carrier, double-sideband large carrier, single sideband, and vestigial sideband modulation formats. Detection techniques for these modulation schemes are also covered. The phase-locked loop for coherent carrier tracking is also presented. Second, analog angle modulation is presented in the forms of frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM). Estimating the bandwidth of the angle modulated carrier is covered, as well as various generation and detection methods. After analog communications are covered, the basics of digital modulation are presented. Sampling theory and analog-to-digital conversion are covered. Particular attention is paid to the signal-to-noise ratio and the aggregate bit rate at the output of the digital modulator. The principles of Nyquist pulse shaping are presented. Particular topics include intersymbol interference, line coding, and power spectral density. A presentation of emerging digital communications technologies concludes the course. Topics may include mobile radio, high definition television, broadband services, video compression, and high-speed local area networks.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 350 or E E 352)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
