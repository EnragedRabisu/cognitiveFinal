"body": "Design/development of embedded systems for data acquisition, process control, and special-purpose computing systems; peripheral interfacing, serial/parallel communications and bus systems. CMPEN 352W Microprocessor-based System Design (3) In this course students learn how to design application specific embedded systems. Embedded systems are increasingly important as they are used in industrial applications, personal computing, and consumer products. Embedded systems are based on microprocessors and microcomputers, but are not intended to be general-purpose computers. In the laboratory students will design, implement, and validate application specific embedded systems. Being a writing-across-curriculum course, students will learn effective techniques of reporting their technical designs.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN351 or CMPEN472 ; E E 210)(Additional Attributes: Writing Across the Curriculum)",
