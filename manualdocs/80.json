"body": "Programming Contest Questions; Common Data Structures; Strings; Sorting; Searching; Combinatorics; Number Theory; Graph Algorithms; Dynamic Programming. This course provides hands-on practice with a wide range of computer science topics that are used to solve programming contest questions. These topics include common data structures; strings; sorting; combinatorics; number theory; graph traversal and other algorithms; dynamic programming. In the course, students will solve a range of programming contest questions, both using an online judge in practice sessions and during actual programming contests. In addition to solving programming problems, the course time will also be used to explore topics mentioned above and the relationship to specific problems, solution techniques, and the analysis of proposed solutions to specific problems. This course is envisioned to be a hands-on lab, with instructor supported, self-guided study. The course topics will be chosen from topics that commonly appear in current programming contests, including but not limited to: - Contest Programming - Common Data Structures - Strings - Sorting - Combinatorics - Number Theory - Graph Traversal and Other Algorithms - Dynamic Programming(Credits: 1)(Prerequisites: CONCURRENT: CMPSC 221)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
