"body": "Concepts of engineering ethics, economy, and project management, senior capstone project selection, and technical communication skills. SWENG 480 Software Engineering Design (3)This course prepares senior software engineering students for industrial engineering design and project management. It covers the engineering design process, project planning and evaluation, engineering ethics, and engineering economy. In addition, students select, specify, and start their capstone design project, which is completed, in the follow-up course, SWENG 481. Students are expected to carry out a group design project that is on par with industrial expectations. Upon completion of this course a student should have a solid understanding of the engineering design process, a clear capstone project description, should have completed some preliminary design work, and be adequately prepared to complete the project in SWENG 481.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: SWENG431)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
