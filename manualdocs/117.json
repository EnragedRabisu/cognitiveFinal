"body": "Computer science capstone project with documentation emphasis. CMPSC 484 CMPSC 484 Computer Science Senior Project I (2) This course is phase one preparation for completing a design for a project to serve as the capstone to the computer science degree program. The course provides instruction and specification of a simulated real-world work environment and associated activities to employ and integrate computer science concepts. Technical instruction and delivered products will be required.Students enrolled in the program will: 1) produce a design for a significant senior project using a cooperative, team approach, 2) present concepts, progress, and products to and interact with peer and faculty review boards. The course will: 1) provide the student with an opportunity to work in a team environment designed around sound development practice, 2) present to students current team organization and management techniques, 3) describe various forms of written communication targeted to different audiences, and 4) reinforce the technical knowledge attained through the computer science curriculum.(Credits: 2)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: ENGL 202C ; CMPSC221 ; CMPSC465)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
