"body": "Computer engineering design project, project management, documentation, reporting, and group and individual communication skills. CMPEN 482W Computer Engineering Project Design (3) The two principle goals of CMPEN 482W are (1) to introduce the fundamentals of systems engineering and systems engineering management, and (2) to develop written and oral communication skills. The course explores the process of translating a problem statement into an effective and economical computer system that meets the needs of the customer. Topics include a comparison of popular process models, analysis and derivation of requirements, requirements allocation and flow down, the work breakdown structure, object-oriented analysis and modeling, the design and development of the user interface, reliability engineering, scheduling, costing, and ethics. Communication skills are developed through oral presentations and a sequence of writing assignments, beginning with a description of requirements and leading to a final design document.CMPEN 482W is not a prerequisite for any other course.CMPEN 482W requires access to PCs or Unix workstations having a C++ compiler. Other specialty hardware or software may be required on a semester-by-semester basis.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 310;E E 353;CMPSC 473;ENGL 202C)(Additional Attributes: Writing Across the Curriculum)",
