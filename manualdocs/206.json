"body": "Analysis of variable-speed drives comprised of AC electric machines, power converters, and control systems. E E 487 Electric Machinery and Drives (3) This course is a technical elective intended for seniors and graduate students interested in electromechanical systems. The first part of the course (approximately two thirds) is devoted to fundamental theory in the modeling and analysis of power converters and AC electric machines. The second part is devoted to the theory and implementation of two specific control schemes: simple volts-per-hertz control applied to the induction machine and high-performance field-oriented control applied to the induction machine and to the permanent magnet machine. The course includes a significant laboratory component consisting of hands-on experience with DSP-based control of drives. Each station in the Electric Machinery and Drives Laboratory is comprised of a dynamometer, an induction machine, a permanent magnet machine, a 3-phase inverter with built-in diode rectifier, a 3-phase power supply, and a DSP-based controller. The DSP-based controller is programmed in the MATLAB/Simulink graphical environment, allowing a student to modify control algorithms easily. Separate computer software allows easy access to controller variables for modification and display. This course builds upon basic knowledge of continuous-time linear systems theory and electric machine modeling. The materials in this course has applications in hybrid/electric vehicles and other transportation systems, industrial processes and automation, and power generation/energy storage systems.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 387)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
