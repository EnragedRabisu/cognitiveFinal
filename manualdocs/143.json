"body": "Design/analysis of electronics circuits including: single/multistage transistor amplifiers, op amp circuits, feedback amplifiers, filters, A/D and D/A converters. E E 313W Electronic Circuit Design II (4) The prerequisite course, E E 310 - Microelectronics 1, covers the basic operation of microelectronic devices and their use in logic circuit design. This course focuses on the design of electronic circuits for amplification, filtering, and A/D and D/A conversion. Advanced circuit design concepts, such as IC biasing, feedback, and frequency response, are covered. This course is designated as writing intensive, and students are required to produce a variety of technical documents based on laboratory work.(Credits: 4)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: E E 310)(Additional Attributes: Writing Across the Curriculum)",
