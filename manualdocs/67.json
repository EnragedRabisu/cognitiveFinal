"body": "OO programming, visual programming, classes, objects, ADTs, inheritance, recursion, regular expressions, user-defined controls, documentation, testing, verification, productivity tools. CMPSC 302 Intermediate Visual Programming (3) This course forms the second of a two course sequence of courses for non-major students. It is designed to build upon concepts and skills presented in the first course, CMPSC 102, with the intent of enabling the student to develop larger scale programs and interface with databases and Web servers using a visual programming language. Some of the topics covered in this course will be object-oriented programming, inheritance, string manipulation, regular expressions, creating custom controls, creating controls dynamically, interfacing with databases and using an appropriate platform, such as ASPX.net to create web pages.This course forms the second of a two course sequence of courses for non-major students. It covers advanced features of the target language , building larger scale programs and interfaces to databases and web servers. It builds on the skills covered in CMPSC-102 and introduces creating new controls, dynamically placing controls at run time, arrays and lists of controls, the use of regular expressions, more in-depth treatment of classes and objects, including inheritance and polymorphism, multi-dimensional arrays, lists, unit testing and project deployment.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPSC102 or CMPSC121)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
