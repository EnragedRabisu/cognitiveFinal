"body": "Design of digital systems using microprocessors. CMPEN 473 Microcomputer Laboratory (3) This laboratory course provides senior students with both theory and practice in designing, implementing, and debugging microprocessor-based systems. Students are guided through a series of projects in which they design, develop, and implement all of the components in a microprocessor based single-board system. After completing the course students will be able to design microprocessor based systems, including both software and hardware design. Students will also be able to use standard system design tools including standard laboratory equipment.This course is a senior level elective for computer engineering majors. CMPEN 472 is a prerequisite for this course.The course requires the use of a design laboratory including standard test equipment such as an oscilloscope, logic analyzer and signal generator as well as a PC with appropriate design software and a microprocessor or EPROM emulation system.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: CMPEN472)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
