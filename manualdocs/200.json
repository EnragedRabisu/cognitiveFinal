"body": "Signals and systems representations, classifications, and analysis using; Difference and Differential equations, Laplace transform, z-transform, Fourier series, FT, FFT, DFT. E E 480 Linear Systems: Time Domain and Transform Analysis (3) Linear Systems: Time Domain and Transform Analysis, is a recommended graduate level course for the Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering at Capital College, since it is a prerequisite for most of the E E prefixed courses offered at this location. The major topics covered in this course include; Signals and Systems representations, classifications, and analysis using; Difference and Differential Equations, Laplace Transform, z-transform, Fourier series, Fourier Transform, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The objective of this course is to develop intuitive and practical understanding of the essentials in signals and systems. The stress is on fundamentals of representation, and analysis of signals and their applications to systems in both discrete and continuous time and frequency domains. This course is designed to prepare the graduate students for more advanced work in broad range areas including communications, control systems, power systems, computer engineering, signal processing and image processing. The quality of students' performances and therefore their course grades are determined via their performance in a midterm exam, a comprehensive final exam, homework assignments, and a course project in accordance with the university's grading policy.(Credits: 3)(Prerequisites: Prerequisite: graduate standing)(Additional Attributes: NONE)",
